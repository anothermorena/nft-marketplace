# NFT MARKET PLACE

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of digital asset secured on a blockchain, which is a decentralized ledger system. The blockchain keeps a record of an NFT's ownership, and its owner has the ability to transfer or trade it. A marketplace is a platform that enables sellers to offer their goods or services to a select group of buyers. This application is built using React Native and serves as a marketplace where users can generate NFTs and place bids on NFTs listed by others. Additionally, the app employs a content-based filtering recommendation system that suggests NFTs to users based on the characteristics of NFTs they've previously interacted with.
