# NFT MARKET PLACE

A non-fungible token is a financial security consisting of digital data stored on a blockchain, a form of distributed ledger. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. A marketplace is a platform where vendors can come together to sell their products or services to a curated customer base. This app is a react native market place where users can create NFTs and bid on other users' NFTs.
